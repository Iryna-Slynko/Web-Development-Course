        Before you take a group class we will show you round our gym. You will meet one of our excellent boxing coaches. They will make an initial assessment of your fitness level. Then the coach will teach you in private how to have the correct stance and throw most common punches and combos.

            You don’t need to bring any equipment with you. Especially if this is your first time. We always have a spare pair of wraps and gloves for you to get started. Alternatively, you can get your own pair of our branded gloves and wraps at our reception for just 70 euro!
