	    <h1>Javascript Events and Handlers Exercises</h1>

	    <p>First revise what you know about events and handlers by reading through the next section and carrying out the tasks described on lines starting with <strong>ACTION:</strong>, then complete the exercises that follow.</p>

	    <h2>Javascript code, events and handlers and their connection</h2>
	    <ul>
		<div id="nice-day-box" class="box fr ml1"><strong>It is a nice day today :-).</strong></div>
		<li>When being interpreted in the browser,  <span class="textxl"><u><strong>Javascript code</strong></u></span> can manipulate the currently loaded HTML page or other aspects of the browser environment. For example, we can write Javascript code to change the contents of the box on the right. The HTML representation of the box is:<pre class="code-listing ">
&lt;div id="nice-day-box" class="box fr ml1">&lt;strong>It is a nice day today :-).&lt;/strong>&lt;/div></pre>
		    <p><em>ACTION: Open this HTML file in a text editor to find the element.</em></p><p>As this element has the id <span class="fw">nice-day-box</span>, we can 'get at' the DOM object representing that element with the method <span class="fw">getElementById</span>. The next line of code gets the object representing the element with id <span class="fw">nice-day-box</span> and assigns it to a variable called <span class="fw">nice_day_box_element</span>.</p><p><em>ACTION: Type it into the console (you can open the console by pressing <strong>F12</strong> and clicking on the <strong>Console</strong> tab), then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key.</em></p><pre class="code-listing">
let nice_day_box_element = document.getElementById("nice-day-box");</pre>
		    <p><em>ACTION: Type the name of the variable into the console:</em></p><pre class="code-listing">
nice_day_box_element</pre>
		    The variable value is displayed. It is an object that can be expanded to reveal sub-structures (attributes of the object). Among the substructures find <span class="fw">innerHTML</span>, <span class="fw">children</span> and <span class="fw">style</span>.
		    <span class="question">What are these?</span><ul class="answer" hidden>
			<li>innerHTML: the content of the element (as a string)</li>
			<li>children: collection of objects representing the child elements</li>
			<li>style: a sub-structure containing information about styles applied to the element</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>We can change the contents of the element by directly modifying the <span class="fw">innerHTML</span> data member of the object.</p>
		    <p><em>ACTION: Run the following instruction in the console:</em></p><pre class="code-listing">
nice_day_box_element.innerHTML = ":-) :-) :-) :-) :-)"</pre>
		    The contents of the box should have changed.

		    <p><em>ACTION: While we are here, try to enter a line of text starting with a double forward slash (<span class="fw">//</span>) into the console. Also try a line that starts with <span class="fw">/*</span> and ends with <span class="fw">*/</span>. For example:</em></p><pre class="code-listing">
// This is a comment - it is ignored by the Javascript interpreter
/* This is also a comment - ignored as well */</pre>
		    <p>There should be no effect, as these are comments in Javascript (syntax for entering explanatory text that is not part of the code).</p>
		</li>
		<li>To get the code to run, we need to feed it <span class="textxl"><u><strong>to the browser's Javascript interpreter for execution</strong></u></span>. There are three ways to do this:
		    <ul>
			<li>through the Javascript <strong>console</strong> in the browser (as demonstrated above)</li>
			<li>by including the code in an HTML page with the use of a <strong>script</strong> element - in this case the code will be executed whenever encountered during the loading of the page (demonstrated in exerise <span class="fw">js_b_in_html</span>)</li>
			<li>by making this piece of code the <strong>handler</strong> for an event - so that when the event happens, the code is executed (demonstrated just below)</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>
		<li>An <span class="textxl"><u><strong>event</strong></u></span> is something that happens in the context of a browser and currently loaded page, for example a mouse click, such as a mouse click on the button:
		    <section class="flcont fljust-start">
			<button type="button" onclick="alert('Here\'s the handler code saying hello!');">My Button</button>
		    </section>
		    or the mouse pointer entering the box:<br/>
		    <section class="flcont fljust-start">
			<div class="box" onmouseover="alert('Alert message');">Bring your mouse pointer over this box.</div>
			
		    </section>
		    This file does not have a handler set up (not yet) for these two example events i.e. nothing happens when we click the button or place the mouse pointer over the box.
		</li>
		
		<li>It is the developer (you!) that specifies code to be executed when an event happens. Making a connection between the event and some Javascript code is called <span class="textxl"><u><strong>setting an event handler</strong></u></span>. Event handlers can be set:
		    <ul>
			<li>programmatically from within Javascript code (we will be doing this in the next few weeks)</li>
			<li>using HTML attributes called <strong>event handler properties</strong>, as follows (for the moment we will be using this method only):
			    <ol>
				<li>the <strong>event handler property</strong> is identified for the chosen event (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">here</a> for a comprehensive list of events); event handler property names follow the pattern <span class="fw">"on" + &lt;event name></span>, for example the event handler property for the <span class="fw">click</span> event is <span class="fw">onclick</span></li>
				<li>the browser can listen for an event only if it is associated with a particular element (click, on what?), called <strong>the target element</strong>, for example if we want the event to be a click on the button <strong>My Button</strong> then that button is the target element</li>
				<li>the event handler property is <strong>added as an attribute</strong> to the target element</li>
				<li>the handler code is <strong>added as the attribute's value</strong></li>
			    </ol>

		<p>Exercise: Element-modifying function as event handler in HTML [EX04]</p>
		<p>Part 1: Set up an event handler on the button below (<strong>Click to change from old to new again</strong>) so that when the button is clicked, the function <span class="fw">renew</span> is called (code: <span class="fw">renew();</span>). The function is defined in file <span class="fw">ex04.js</span> and the file included via the <span class="fw">script</span> element just above this exercise. You will also need to add the correct id to the element that is being changed by the function. You will be able to say what the id is by looking at the function.</p>
		<p>Part 2: Add another button element between the button and the box with text below, then set up a handler that hides the box with text. The property that needs to be changed on the object representing the element is <span class="fw">hidden</span> and it needs to be assigned the value <span class="fw">true</span> (in the same way that previously we were assigining some text to the property <span class="fw">innerHTML</span>). Write the handler as a function and define it, giving it a name of your choice, in file <span class="fw">ex04.js</span>.</p>
